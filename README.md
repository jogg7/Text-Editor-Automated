<h2> How it Works </h2>

This automated text editor uses a linked list to manage text in rows, allowing dynamic text manipulation such as adding, deleting, and moving letters within the rows. Each row is represented by a linked list, where each node contains a character and pointers to the next and previous nodes. The editor processes commands from an input file, including creating new lines, deleting specific characters, moving the cursor, and backspacing. The text is displayed and updated on the screen as commands are executed, simulating a simple text editing environment.
